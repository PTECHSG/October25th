### Building a Chatbot

Hi Team, for today we will be going through the fundamentals of building a virtual assistant on IBM Cloud! 
Here is a **blog post** written by my colleague, that you could read up on prior to the session: https://medium.com/@ernesenorelus/designing-a-chatbot-with-ibm-watson-assistant-7e11b94c2b3d

The three fundamental concepts are:
- Entity
- Intent
- Dialog
